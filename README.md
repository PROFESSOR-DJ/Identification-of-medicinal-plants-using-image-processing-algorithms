# Project Documentation: Identification of Medicinal Plants/Raw Materials through Image Processing Using Machine Learning

## Ministry of AYUSH - Student Innovation Hackathon (SIH1343)


### Project Overview:
Our project aims to address the challenge of accurately identifying medicinal plant species and raw materials through the use of a web application. Leveraging image processing and machine learning algorithms, the application allows users to upload or capture images of plant specimens, providing precise identification and detailed information relevant to the field of medicine.

### Technology Stack:
- **Python:** 3.11.5
- **Flask Framework:** 2.3.3
- **Plant Species & Raw Materials Image Dataset**
- **Visual Studio Code:** 1.82
- **Firebase Database:** 12.5.1
- **Google Colaboratory**

### Approach:
Our sophisticated solution involves a robust system that processes images through advanced algorithms. The key steps include:
1. **Image Input:** Users can upload or capture images using the mobile app.
2. **Image Processing:** Advanced image processing algorithms examine the morphological attributes of the images.
3. **Machine Learning:** The system employs machine learning algorithms for accurate classification of plant species and raw materials.

### Use Cases:
1. **Image Upload/Capture:** Users can upload images or capture photos of plant species or raw materials.
2. **Species Identification:** Advanced image recognition technology identifies the species, providing comprehensive information for medicinal purposes.


### Features:
- **User-Friendly UI:** The mobile application boasts a thoughtfully designed interface for ease of use.
- **Text-to-Speech Functionality:** Manual activation of text-to-speech enhances accessibility for users with hearing impairments or physical challenges.
- **Cross-Domain Applicability:** Valuable for Ayurvedic practitioners, paramedical personnel, biomedical experts, scientists, botanists, and students.

### Dependencies/Show Stoppers:
- **Web Application:** Seamlessly integrated for convenient access and user-friendliness.
- **Text-to-Speech Functionality:** Enhances accessibility and usability.
- **Versatility:** Applicable across various domains, facilitating research, identification, and learning.

### Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open in Visual Studio Code: `code .`
4. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`
5. Access the application through the provided URL.

### Future Enhancements:
1. Integration of additional image datasets for expanded plant species recognition.
2. Continuous refinement of machine learning algorithms for improved accuracy.
3. Inclusion of real-time collaboration features in the research repository.
